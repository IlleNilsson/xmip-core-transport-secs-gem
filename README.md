# xmip-core-transport-secs-gem

SECS/GEM transport: HSMS over TCP with select, linktest and separate, SECS-II items encoded and decoded, each data message a Stream addressed by stream and function — the semiconductor equipment interface. A technology of [xmip-core-transport](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-transport).

A Receive Location keeps its listener, bound on the first receive (`transport::kept::Kept`): a peer that connects between two receives is queued and taken by the next, where until 2026-09-27 each receive bound a listener of its own and a peer between receives was refused.

A send target is read by `net::Target` in [xmip-core-library-net](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-library-net), the one reading of a URI every technology calls, and its query is decoded there. Until 2026-09-28 this technology split the query off itself, without percent-decoding it.
